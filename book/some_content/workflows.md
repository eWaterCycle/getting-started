# Different Types of Workflows

Here we will link to research applications using eWaterCycle.
These are examples of workflows, they might not work with the current version of eWaterCycle.

Here is a quick overview:

## Running a Model

### Flooding

Using CMIP6 future data together with a calibrated HBV model, Thirza van Esch did research into the flooding of the Wien River.
As part of her BSc thesis.

### Droughts

Using a calibrated HBV model with CMIP 6 future data, Ischa Hollemans looked at droughts of the Loire River.
As part of his BSc thesis.

### Climate Change

## Calibrating Models

### HBV

Here Thirza van Esch used RMSE and the Nelder-Mead optimization to calibrate her HBV model for floodings.
