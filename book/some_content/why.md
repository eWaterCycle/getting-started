# Why eWaterCycle

Hydrological modeling is essential for understanding and managing water systems, but it suffers from major challenges: 
fragmented tools, lack of reproducibility, limited interoperability, and barriers to collaboration. 
Scientists often struggle to share, compare, or reproduce model-based results. 
There was a clear need for a modern platform that supports transparent, reproducible, and collaborative hydrological research.

eWaterCycle has been developed to take away programming and compatibility issues within hydrological modelling.
It is designed in a FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable) way.
Many models use different input/outputs formats, making interoperability hard.
This is what eWaterCycle changes.
It utilizes the Basic Model Interface (BMI) to improve interoperability between all the models.
