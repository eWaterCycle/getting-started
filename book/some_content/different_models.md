# Different Models

Here we will show you the different models that are available in eWaterCycle and what their needs and benefits are.
**NOTE** the following notebooks are from their respective GitHub pages and are not meant for this getting started guide specifically.

## HBV 

HBV (Hydrologiska Byr√•ns Vattenbalansavdelning) is a conceptual hydrological model. For more information on its history, see this [paper](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/1371/2022/).
The actual model implemented here sit looks most like the original model from [1976](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:smhi:diva-5738).
