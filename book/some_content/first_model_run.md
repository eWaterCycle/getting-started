# First Model Run

Here we will go through a first model run with eWaterCycle. 
First we will walk you through the interface of eWaterCycle, which is a Jupyter Hub.
Then we will run an HBV model with forcing data.
After that we will look at the different ways of generating forcing data.
Finally, we will look at the different models that are available in eWaterCycle.

Below you will find a short overview of the content of this part.

## Interface

The eWaterCycle interface is a Jupyter Hub environment, which means you can run Jupyter notebooks in your browser.
And the heavy computations are done at a super computer, so you do not need a powerful computer to run the models.
This super computer is hosted by SURF, the Dutch national supercomputer provider.
So the jupyter hub sends the requests to the super computer, which runs the models and sends the results back to your browser.

This does mean that you need an internet connection to use eWaterCycle as it is now.
You also need basic knowledge of Python to be able to use eWaterCycle.

## Running an HBV Model

Here we will pick a catchment and run an HBV model with forcing data.
To show you how eWaterCycle works in practice.
This is a simple example, but it will give you an idea of how to use eWaterCycle.

### Getting Forcing Data

There are different ways to get forcing data for your model run that are supported by eWaterCycle.
They also differ per model, so you will have to check the documentation of the model you want to use.

### Different Models

Here we will show you the different models that are available in eWaterCycle.
And how to change the model you want to use in your Jupyter notebook.
**NOTE** we will not be running the models here.
