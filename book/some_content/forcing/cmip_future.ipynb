    "CMIP has these climate scenarios based on carbon emissions, go [here](https://climate-scenarios.canada.ca/?page=cmip6-overview-notes) (or [here](https://www.dkrz.de/en/communication/climate-simulations/cmip6-en/the-ssp-scenarios)) to find out more!\n",
    "Here I set up SSP1, 2 and 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SSP1**: The sustainable and “green” pathway describes an increasingly sustainable world. Global commons are being preserved, the limits of nature are being respected. The focus is more on human well-being than on economic growth. Income inequalities between states and within states are being reduced. Consumption is oriented towards minimizing material resource and energy usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SSP2**: The “Middle of the road” or medium pathway extrapolates the past and current global development into the future. Income trends in different countries are diverging significantly. There is a certain cooperation between states, but it is barely expanded. Global population growth is moderate, leveling off in the second half of the century. Environmental systems are facing a certain degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SSP3**: Regional rivalry. A revival of nationalism and regional conflicts pushes global issues into the background. Policies increasingly focus on questions of national and regional security. Investments in education and technological development are decreasing. Inequality is rising. Some regions suffer drastic environmental damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SSP4**: Inequality. The chasm between globally cooperating developed societies and those stalling at a lower developmental stage with low income and a low level of education is widening. Environmental policies are successful in tackling local problems in some regions, but not in others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SSP5**: Fossil-fueled Development. Global markets are increasingly integrated, leading to innovations and technological progress. The social and economic development, however, is based on an intensified exploitation of fossil fuel resources with a high percentage of coal and an energy-intensive lifestyle worldwide. The world economy is growing and local environmental problems such as air pollution are being tackled successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers behind the SSP1xx mean extra radiative forcing of $x.x$ $W/m^2$ by the year 2100. They come in at $1.9$, $2.6$, $3.4$, $4.5$, $6.0$, $7.0$ and $8.5$ $W/m^2$, more [*info*](https://www.dkrz.de/en/communication/climate-simulations/cmip6-en/the-ssp-scenarios).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to pick just one scenario and use different ensembles to reach a statistically better result!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are saving it to their respective folder we only have to run the data gathering **ONCE**.\n",
    "As you will notice it will take a longer time to gather the forcing data.\n",
    "After this gathering we will just be using the saved files, which should be done in a separate notebook, but is done in this notebook for the sake of simplicity."
