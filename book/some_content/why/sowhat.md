# So What

eWaterCycle helps hydrologists & students to accelerate scientific discovery, improve collaboration, and enhance decision-making. 
By making models and workflows reproducible and shareable, it bridges the gap between individual research and global water challenges. 
It also helps in validation your own models, by easily being able to switch between models.

It supports education (BSc + MSc + PhD Theses & Master courses), promotes openness, and provides a foundation for more reliable water management, especially in the context of climate change and sustainable development.

Everyone is also encouraged to share their models/data with the eWaterCycle team to make them compatible.
We would gladly help you with this!
