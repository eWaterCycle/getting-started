# What is eWaterCycle

eWaterCycle provides a standardized environment (often using containers and Jupyter Notebooks).

Supports running multiple hydrological models in a reproducible way.
Models include:
- HBV
- PCRGlobWB
- Wflow
- Lisflood
- Marmot

Facilitates coupling with data sources, visualization, and advanced workflows.


eWaterCycle addresses the challenges by providing an open, modular, and reproducible modeling platform. 
It uses Jupyter Notebooks as a userinterface, containerized environments, and standardized interfaces (e.g. BMI â€“ Basic Model Interface) to allow users to:
- Run and couple different hydrological models.
- Access and preprocess input data seamlessly.
- Reproduce results and share workflows across institutions.
- Follow FAIR data principles, enhancing trust and transparency.

The platform is designed with researchers in mind, enabling both simple experiments and complex coupled simulations.
